# RestaurantGoGo

## Objective: 
Implement ASP.NET Core, SQL/SSMS with Azure services with frontend Typescript/Angular 12. 

## About the Project:
Restaurant A Go Go was designed for hungry and indecisive people.  The main feature is a "randomizer" function that selects a random restaurant from a list in your area for you to go to when you can't decide where to eat.  The application can be used to show a selection of restaurants according to your zip code by a variety of categories.  The application also has a favorite function that stores a personal list of your favorite restaurants.
